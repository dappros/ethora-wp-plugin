## Description

This plugin allows you to inject a hosted JavaScript file (e.g., Ethora chatbot) into the header or footer of every WordPress page.

You can configure:
- The `data-bot-id` attribute - your bot's unique XMPP handle, generated automatically if you use Ethora platform
- (optional) The `data-bot-avatar` attribute - URL of avatar or profile image your AI agent uses in chat sessions
- (optional) The `data-bot-display-name` attribute - the display name your AI agent uses in chat sessions
- Whether the script loads in the `<head>` or before `</body>`.

Example (auto-generated by the plugin):

```js
<script
  src="https://widget.ethora.com/assistant.js"
  id="chat-content-assistant"
  data-bot-id="<your bot's XMPP handle here>"
  data-bot-avatar="http://myhosting.com/avatar.png"
  data-bot-display-name="Captain Nemo"
></script>
```

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: Can I change the script URL?**
